**Compiler:**
- **Definition:** A compiler is a translator program that converts source code written in a high-level language (e.g., Java, C++) to equivalent machine language in one go.
- **Working:** It converts the entire program to executable object code if the program is error-free. Errors are highlighted at the end of the entire program execution.
- **Output:** Produces an executable file that can run without the need for source code.
- **Advantages:**
  - Faster execution compared to other language processors.
  - More secure as the actual source program can be hidden.
  - Well-optimized machine code.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Debugging is relatively tough.
  - Requires a lot of memory for producing an object file.
  - Source code needs to be recompiled every time there is a change.

**Assembler:**
- **Definition:** An assembler is a translator program that converts assembly language or low-level programming language to machine code.
- **Working:** Works in two phases - first and second phase, converting mnemonics (instructions) into machine code.
- **Output:** Efficient translation system software that is as fast as machine language.
- **Advantages:**
  - Very fast translation.
  - Efficient like machine language.
  - Easier development compared to compiler and interpreter.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Lower-level machine language is difficult to understand.
  - Changes with the architecture of machines.
  - Difficult to debug.

**Interpreter:**
- **Definition:** An interpreter converts source programs written in high-level programming languages into machine code line by line.
- **Working:** Executes one line at a time, converts and executes simultaneously. Pauses execution if an error is encountered until the error is fixed.
- **Output:** No intermediate object code, less memory consumption.
- **Advantages:**
  - Easy to find and debug errors from the code.
  - Less memory consumption.
  - Allows programmers to see their code running line by line.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Takes time to convert and execute instructions line by line.
  - Not suitable for large programs.
  - Less secure for privacy.

**Difference Between Compiler, Interpreter, and Assembler:**
- **Assembler vs. Compiler:**
  - Debugging is easier in the case of the compiler.
  - The compiler is more intelligent than the assembler.
  - The compiler scans the entire program before converting it into machine code.

- **Compiler vs. Interpreter:**
  - Compiler translates a high-level language into machine code at once, while an interpreter does it line by line.
  - A translator program is required each time for execution with a compiler, but not with an interpreter.
  - Compiler creates and stores an object file, whereas an interpreter does not.

**Why Compiler is Preferred:**
- Compilers are preferred over assemblers and interpreters because they translate and execute code faster.
- Compilers create and store an object file, eliminating the need for recompilation.
- All errors are found and displayed together at the end.

**Conclusion:**
- Compilers are widely used for high-level languages like Java and C++, interpreters for languages like Python, and assemblers are rarely used.
- Compilers are favored for their speed, optimized machine code, and efficient handling of errors.
- The choice between these language processors depends on the nature and requirements of the programming task.
